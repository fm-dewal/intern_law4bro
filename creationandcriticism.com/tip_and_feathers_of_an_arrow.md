## **Introduction, Chapter I**
The rights and wrongs of a person, artificial or natural, are the person's identity, wherein the Law of Tort is enforced whenever a person is found in the wrong. This requirement by the procedure established by law grants the Law of Tort an ever evolving status to govern public policy, societal changes, technological advancements and the environment.

Law cannot be created ab-initio and mandates overlapping civil jurisdictions for The Law of Tort and other civil acts, number 9 of 1872, The Contract Act; and number 47 of 1963, The Specific Relief Act. The overlapping further the claim of amendment to rights and duties, liability and consequence, protection to incorporeal properties and civil procedures including evidence, mandatory injunction on artificial or natural legal entities.

The principles of liabilities, vicarious, strict and absolute, as utilized by the Courts of Law. Vicarious liabilities do not arise in Criminal Law, Ravula Hariprasada Rao v. State, 1951 SCC 241.

    #reasonable restrictions Vs. Jus naturale
    Reasonable restrictions apply to citizens under The Constitution of India
    wherein rights in rem have been surrendered to The Constitution.
    A just example of such surrendering of rights by the State is provided under
    Article 20 of The Constitution of India and in Common Law under the principle Nullum crimen nulla poena sine lege <ref_ncnpsl>
    #CoI.20: ex-post facto, double jeopardy, self-incrimination
    #audi alteram partum Vs. ex-parte judgement


## Statutory Provisions, Chapter II
The Law of Tort is a branch of Law, under the Supreme Law of The Land, The Constitution of India. The Constitution of India grants exemplary powers to each of its organ to build the nation. Reasonable restrictions apply to citizens and rights in rem are surrendered to The Constitution. Such surrendering of rights by the State is provided under article 20 and in Common Law under the principle, `Nullum crimen nulla poena sine lege`, which provides that neither conviction nor punishment of a person is to be without either law or lawful procedure.
